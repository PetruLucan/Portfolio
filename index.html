                            This is the moment when I first came in touch with real programming. The

                            well orgranised text( or better name it -code-), the multittude of instructions I was able
                            to
                            use in
                            order to create pretty much everything I desired, my brain was releasing dopamine just by
                            watching
                            the screen filled by code while scrolling, the thought that my dreams can come true...
                            Fantastic!<br>
                            Here is where I learned, from an awesome trainer, together with 3 other colleagues, the
                            fundamentals
                            of
                            JavaScript (with it's history and all), HTML:5, CSS3, Soft skills, we got intruduced to the
                            CEO
                            of a
                            IT company to get the feeling
                            and workflow from the inside, we alse got some tips from his employees to improve the
                            project we
                            developed so far.<br>
                            We also had a part of our time dedicated to each working methodologies from the field: Agile

                            A great experience nontheless because they gave me the opportunity to leave my country for
                            the
                            fist
                            time and go to Spain - Tenerife for a month long training stage period in: Network
                            fundamentals,
                            Routing protocols and concepts, LAN switching and wireless, from where I obtained a CISCO
                            certification for each mentioned specialization.<br>
                            In preparation for the stage, the school provided us with a great spanish teacher where we
                            developed
                            our language proficiency up A2 level, where I had ability to deal with simple,

                            have
